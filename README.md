# Firefox-Theme
Loosely based on both https://github.com/khuedoan/one-line-firefox and https://github.com/CristianDragos/FirefoxThemes/tree/master/Simplify%20Sunset, The first was used for the one-line theme, but edited to fit my needs, and the second was used as a source on how to theme various UI elements - since I have many of them hidden, unnecessary lines were removed, and same colors were often combined into a single define.

Thanks to both of the original authors for their work - I could not have managed my theme without theirs.
