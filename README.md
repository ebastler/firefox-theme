# Firefox-Theme
Loosely based on both https://github.com/khuedoan/one-line-firefox and https://github.com/CristianDragos/FirefoxThemes/tree/master/Simplify%20Sunset, The first was used for the one-line theme, but edited to fit my needs, and the second was used as a source on how to theme various UI elements - since I have many of them hidden, unnecessary lines were removed, and same colors were often combined into a single define.

Thanks to both of the original authors for their work - I could not have managed my theme without theirs.

# How to install:
* open `about:config`
    * `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets: true`
    * `browser.compactmode.show: true`
    * `extensions.pocket.enabled: false`
* Use compact density toolbar, remove all spaces and/or unnecessary icons
* Go to your FF profile folder (easiest way: use `about:support` to find it), create a folder called `chrome`, clone this repository inside it.
